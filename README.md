## The Insider’s Guide to Working with Thiago

* I appreciate critical feedback—please let me know if you disagree with me or think there's a better approach. 
* I generally assume positive intent from people.
* I am biased toward action and expect the same from my teammates. The data from a small experiment is more valuable than weeks of just talking.
* You should receive feedback as soon as possible. If you are surprised by the content of our performance reviews, I’ve failed in my role.
* I have opinions on many things but tend to keep them to myself. If you're curious about my thoughts, just ask!
* I’ll occasionally check Slack outside of business hours. Unless it is a critical issue and you get paged, I do not expect your response until regular working hours.
* I’m somewhere between an extrovert and an introvert (often called an ambivert). I love social interactions but sometimes need time alone to recharge. 

This document is a work in progress and reflects my perspective. The best way to learn how to work together is by doing it—with honest, open, and transparent communication.
